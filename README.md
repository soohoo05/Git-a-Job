Git-A-Job Backend

By Donovan Dwyer and Tyler Soo Hoo

Git-A-Job lets you search for jobs using the "Github Jobs" API. You can search for jobs based off of description (like what language or kind of job), location and if you want the list to be part time or full time jobs. You will be able to see a detailed description of a job including company logo, How to apply, etc. 

Users will be able to save their data as well as email a job that they like. 


Backend portion includes emailing users and serves as the API for the frontend to call on to save jobs, users and jobs that users want to save to their list.
