Our job is to create and enable routing solutions for our products and customers. We are looking for a backend-focused engineer to join our great squad. The main programming languages we use are Java 8 and Javascript ES6, but we believe that continuous learning is essential in an ever-changing and fast-paced technological environment.<br></p>\n\n<p><b>FIRST A QUICK LOOK AT US</b><br>\nOur vision is a planet without traffic jams. Our mission is to transform cities by providing the most convenient and sustainable mobility solutions. We create outstanding products with technical excellence, an agile mindset, an open feedback and failure culture and fun at work. moovel is part of a large global corporation (Daimler AG), but at the heart of it we still are a startup. We act as a partner for cities, transport networks and mobility service providers with the goal of making cities smarter and creating an operating system for urban mobility that provides access to appropriate mobility options in urban areas and paves the way for the future with autonomous vehicles. Currently, 280 employees work in small creative teams in Germany and the US at four locations - Hamburg, Berlin, Stuttgart and Portland.<br></p>\n\n<p><b>HOW THE ROLE WORKS</b><br>\nWe gather in small engineering teams organized around specific topics. The individual teams enjoy a high degree of autonomy, trust and responsibility. Innovation is key and very much encouraged and embraced in our teams. We value pragmatism, simplicity and collaboration. We live an open feedback and failure culture, because we know that both are necessary to find proper solutions. With us you will use state of the art technology and work self-determined in small, autonomous and agile teams. moovel tries to maintain a culture where engineers are provided with the tools of their choice and a friendly environment in which they can thrive.<br></p>\n\n<p><b>SOME OF THE THINGS YOU WILL DO</b><br>\nTeams at moovel choose the tools they regard as the best fit for their problems, at their discretion. Hence the technology stack is rather diverse. We employ a microservice backend architecture based on Docker and AWS. Cloud Services are leveraged wherever they help us to focus on our task. We practice Continuous Delivery and value DevOps culture (you build it, you run it).<br></p>\n\n<p>• You design, implement, scale and monitor our routing backend which provides vehicle, public transport and intermodal directions for our mobility apps and platform<br>\n• You implement routing algorithms in Java<br>\n• You design and provide APIs around our routing services<br>\n• You are involved in building infrastructure and tooling for importing data into our routing engine<br>\n• You perform analysis to enable data driven decisions<br>\n• You collaborate with cross-functional teams to define, design and ship new features<br></p>\n\n<p><b>ABOUT YOU</b><br>\nYou should have experience in writing, maintaining &amp; debugging Java code and should be concerned about clean, high quality and maintainable code. Graph theory and routing algorithms are well known to you. Also, vehicle routing problems (VRP) are no strangers to you or at least something you always wanted to learn more about and master. You have experience with and are open to get deep into OSM and GTFS data formats. Some exposure to service based architectures would be useful. Since we are working in a rapidly evolving environment you should be open to pick up new languages, tools and frameworks. Furthermore, we are working with Amazon Web Services so it would be good if you are familiar with cloud computing. As it is our corporate language, you should have good writing and verbal communication skills in English.<br></p>\n\n<p><b>BENEFITS</b><br></p>\n\n<p>• Choose your own hardware<br>\n• Working with newest technologies &amp; microservices<br>\n• Company pension plan<br>\n• Free breakfast, coffee &amp; water<br>\n• Mobility allowance<br>\n• Be part of an interdisciplinary team of experts<br>\n• Working on products with a high impact on society<br>\n• International teams<br>\n• Child care allowance<br>\n• Flexible working hours<br></p>\n\n<p>You bring what we are looking for?

The responsibilities range from designing and developing end-to-end applications, planning and developing new site features, and extending existing applications to keeping web systems up-to-date, and integrating 3rd party applications with the school's application stack. The role requires excellent technical skills, analytical and creative problem solving skills, an ability to work independently or with a group, initiative, and high personal standards for quality work.</p>\n\n<p>US</p>\n\n<p>The Technology Development Group at NYU School of Law is a small, versatile, full stack development team. The vast majority of our development is in C#/.NET, with additional projects in PHP (Laravel) … both using Vue as our front-end framework.</p>\n\n<p>Our group develops and supports the school's website (Drupal), micro sites (usually WordPress), reporting, and administrative applications (both internal and public). We've been known to divert our energies towards improving our supporting infrastructure, and now run many of our services using Docker/Kubernetes/Terraform, and that only as part of our growing AWS presence. We're usually getting ourselves into trouble with interesting projects.</p>\n\n<p>YOU</p>\n\n<p>We're looking to add a developer who is flexible enough to code across different environments. Maybe you have experience in another language and are looking to switch it up. You're already good, but want to be better … and you want to learn new things and grow. Regardless, have an opinion, because we genuinely want to hear it!</p>\n\n<p>WHY</p>\n\n<p>As an employee of NYU Law, you would receive NYU's benefits (<a href=\"https://www.nyu.edu/employees/benefit.html\">https://www.nyu.edu/employees/benefit.html</a>), including excellent health coverage, retirement plans, and tuition remission.

The responsibilities range from designing and developing end-to-end applications, planning and developing new site features, and extending existing applications to keeping web systems up-to-date, and integrating 3rd party applications with the school's application stack. The role requires excellent technical skills, analytical and creative problem solving skills, an ability to work independently or with a group, initiative, and high personal standards for quality work.</p>\n\n<p>US</p>\n\n<p>The Technology Development Group at NYU School of Law is a small, versatile, full stack development team. The vast majority of our development is in C#/.NET, with additional projects in PHP (Laravel) … both using Vue as our front-end framework.</p>\n\n<p>Our group develops and supports the school's website (Drupal), micro sites (usually WordPress), reporting, and administrative applications (both internal and public). We've been known to divert our energies towards improving our supporting infrastructure, and now run many of our services using Docker/Kubernetes/Terraform, and that only as part of our growing AWS presence. We're usually getting ourselves into trouble with interesting projects.</p>\n\n<p>YOU</p>\n\n<p>We're looking to add a developer who is flexible enough to code across different environments. Maybe you have experience in another language and are looking to switch it up. You're already good, but want to be better … and you want to learn new things and grow. Regardless, have an opinion, because we genuinely want to hear it!</p>\n\n<p>WHY</p>\n\n<p>As an employee of NYU Law, you would receive NYU's benefits (<a href=\"https://www.nyu.edu/employees/benefit.html\">https://www.nyu.edu/employees/benefit.html</a>), including excellent health coverage, retirement plans, and tuition remission. You would be part of a team of creative, talented technologists who continue to make NYU Law one of the top law schools in the country!
